The task involves processing Hi-C interaction data from a CSV file to identify significant interactions between genomic loci in Bacillus. The goal is to determine the top 20 interactions for each source node, where the first 10 interactions are the highest overall, and the subsequent 10 are interactions with target nodes at least 50 nodes apart. The process includes reading the CSV data, renaming columns for consistency, creating a sparse matrix to handle interactions, ensuring symmetry, and applying a threshold based on the 95th percentile of interaction values. Finally, the top interactions are filtered and saved in JSON format, with an additional CSV file mapping original and mapped node identifiers. The resulting data provides insights into the most significant and spatially distant genomic interactions, useful for further genomic analysis.
